                                    of Resolution</strong>. You and Hook0 agree that any disputes arising under
                                these terms or otherwise in connection with your use of the Site will be resolved
                                through arbitration under the French law of international arbitration as amended from

                                French language. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that: (i) the courts in any
                                relevant venue will have jurisdiction for the purposes of obtaining and enforcing
                                injunctive or other equitable relief, and for the purposes of enforcing the decision of
                                any arbitrator appointed in accordance with this provision, and (ii) Hook0 may

                                Further, unless both you and Hook0 otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may
                                not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any
                                form of any class or representative proceeding. If this paragraph is held unenforceable,

                                    and Venue</strong>. If Section 11.2 is deemed void or is otherwise inapplicable, all
                                disputes under these Terms will be resolved by a court of competent jurisdiction located

                                renders the performance of such obligations so difficult or costly as to make
